# F1ian
Some sort of Formula 1 data representation - form yet to be determined

Primarily built for those F1ians like myself who enjoy watching replays of races past. Made so much more enjoyable with some sporting and historical context around it (championship positions pre and post race, qualifying and starting grid, current political fuss, rule changes, spicy driver feuds).

It's a pretty handy reference tool too, so it has that going for it which is nice.
