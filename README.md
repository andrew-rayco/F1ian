# F1
Some sort of Formula 1 data representation - form yet to be determined

Primarily built for those F1ians like myself who enjoys watching replays of races past. I've found I enjoy them so much more when I have some context around it (championship positions pre and post race, qualifying and starting grid, current political fuss, rule changes, spicy driver feuds).

It's a pretty handy reference tool too, so it has that going for it which is nice.
